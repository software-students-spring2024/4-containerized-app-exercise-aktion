# Containerized App Exercise

Build a containerized app that uses machine learning. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

# Description

This project is a weather dashboard application that recommends the users what clothes to wear outside and what activities they could engage in. Users will enter their information and preferences on weather as well as how they react to different climates for more personalization. The user's location information will be used to determine the weather and predict the forecast for the next 12 hours in that location. A machine learning model has been trained to predict the weather based off past weather data.
